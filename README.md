# Bullseye

## Level 1

***PC- A player with a fireball***

***NPC- Chimneys  throw balls to obstruct the player***

***Goal- The goal of the game is that the player should hit the target by throwing a fireball which will be obstructed by some water balls thrown by the chimney.***

***Rules- The player can throw the fireball by pressing the right arrow key. The player should not touch the water balls, if he touches it, then his life would reduce.*** ***There will be three lives for the player to hit the target and he has to hit it three times. If he loses he should go to the next level.***

***Balance- The game which I created is balanced because by pressing the right arrow key the player just moves slowly so he can manage to get through the balls. Whereas if  I command the ball to go fast when the right arrow key is pressed it will become very difficult and makes the game boring.***

***Game adaptivity - The game becomes increasingly difficult in the second level.***

***Element of chance - In this game we cannot say 100% that the player hits the target .***

***Element of skill - It is the skill of the player to move the balls through the water balls.***

***Feedback - Feedback will be displayed after each level.***

***Story - The story of this game is that the boy (player)  who is throwing the ball is a prince and the water balls are being thrown by the princess's father. So the princess's father has kept a test for the prince in his aiming skill, if he hit the bullseye then the prince could marry the princess.***

## Level 2

***This is the continuation of Level 1 where the the chimneys would be increased and  speed of the black balls would be increased and the target will be a moving target.*** ***After this level, in level 3 a new game starts***.

***So when the prince finishes the two levels he can marry the princess.*** ***Here there will be only one life and the player should hit it three times.***

***Rules - The doctor should kill the corona before it reaches the people.***
